ExTwilio is a relatively full-featured API client for the Twilio API.

## Installation

ExTwilio is currently beta software. You can install it from Hex:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_twilio, "~> 0.9.1"}
  ]
end
```

Or from Github:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_twilio, github: "danielberkompas/ex_twilio"}
  ]
end
```

and run `mix deps.get`.


If using Elixir 1.3 or lower add `:ex_twilio` as a application dependency:

```elixir
def application do
  [
    applications: [:ex_twilio]
  ]
end
```

## Configuration

You will need to set the following configuration variables in your
`config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :ex_twilio, account_sid:   {:system, "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"},
                   auth_token:    {:system, "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"},
                   workspace_sid: {:system, "TWILIO_WORKSPACE_SID"} # optional
```

For security, I recommend that you use environment variables rather than hard
coding your account credentials. If you don't already have an environment
variable manager, you can create a `.env` file in your project with the
following content:

```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<account sid here>
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth token>
export TWILIO_WORKSPACE_SID=<workspace sid here> #optional
```

Then, just be sure to run `source .env` in your shell before compiling your
project.

### Multiple Environments
If you want to use different Twilio credentials for different environments, then
create separate Mix configuration files for each environment. To do this, change
`config/config.exs` to look like this:

```elixir
# config/config.exs

use Mix.Config

# shared configuration for all environments here ...

import_config "#{Mix.env}.exs"
```

Then, create a `config/#{environment_name}.exs` file for each environment. You
can then set the `config :ex_twilio` variables differently in each file.

## Usage

ExTwilio comes with a module for each supported Twilio API resource. For example,
the "Call" resource is accessible through the `ExTwilio.Call` module. Depending
on what the underlying API supports, a resource module may have the following
methods:

| Method      | Description                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **all**     | Eager load all of the resource items on all pages. Use with care! |
| **stream**  | Create a Stream of all the items. Use like any Stream.            |
| **find**    | Find a resource given its SID.                                    |
| **create**  | Create a resource.                                                |
| **update**  | Update a resource.                                                |
| **destroy** | Destroy a resource.                                               |

Resource modules may contain their own custom methods. If the underlying API
endpoint does not support an action, the related method will _not_ be available
on that module.

### Example

```elixir
# Get all the calls in the Call endpoint. Be warned, this will block
# until all the pages of calls have been fetched.
calls = ExTwilio.Call.all

# Create a stream of all the calls
stream = ExTwilio.Call.stream

# Lazily filter calls by duration, then map to get only their SIDs
stream
|> Stream.filter(fn(call) -> call.duration > 120 end)
|> Stream.map(fn(call) -> call.sid end)
|> Enum.into([]) # Only here does any work happen.
# => ["CAc14d7...", "CA649ea861..."]

# Find a call
{:ok, call} = ExTwilio.Call.find("CA13a9c7f80c6f3761fabae43242b5b6c6")
inspect(call)
# %ExTwilio.Call{
#   account_sid: "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
#   answered_by: nil, caller_name: "",
#   date_created: "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 14:27:38 +0000",
#   date_updated: "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 14:28:35 +0000",
#   direction: "outbound-api",
#   duration: "52",
#   end_time: "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 14:28:35 +0000",
#   forwarded_from: nil,
#   from: "+1xxxxxxxxxx",
#   parent_call_sid: nil,
#   phone_number_sid: "",
#   price: "-0.01500",
#   price_unit: "USD",
#   sid: "CA13a9c7f80c6f3761fabae43242b5b6c6",
#   start_time: "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 14:27:43 +0000",
#   status: "completed",
#   to: "+1xxxxxxxxxx",
#   uri: "/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/Calls/CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.json"
# }

# Update a call
call = ExTwilio.Call.update(call, status: "canceled")

# Get a call's recordings. This pattern is repeated wherever you are
# getting a nested resource.
recordings = ExTwilio.Recording.all(call: call.sid)

# Destroy a call
ExTwilio.Call.destroy(call)
```
